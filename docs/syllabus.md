## Accommodations for Learning Differences

If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class, [register your needs] with the [Disability Resource Center (DRC)] to initiate an accommodations support process. The

DRC can be reached at (503) 725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu. Once you have coordinated with the DRC, please contact me to make sure that I have received a faculty notification letter and we can discuss your needs for the term.

PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, usable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me.

## Academic Integrity

Review the [Student Conduct Code] to become familiar with your rights, responsibilities and the behaviors for which a student may be subject to disciplinary action. An act of academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, [plagiarism], misrepresenting or improper/no citing that leads the instructor/viewer of content to believe that the writing and content are original to you, or unauthorized possession of examinations will automatically result in a grade of “F” for the affected assignment, and the case will be referred to university authorities. University authorities have the ability to escalate matters to the level of expulsion. Make sure you keep electronic copies of all your assignments also outside of D2L so that you can produce them should the need arise.

Many of PSU's online courses use the [Turnitin plagiarism assessment tool] to evaluate assignments. This tool checks submissions against a database of published works, as well as other students' papers. You can review your Turnitin report before submitting an assignment and make necessary revisions. If you are still unclear as to what constitutes plagiarism, please review the [PSU Library's Citation Tutorial].

## Data Privacy

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords students certain rights with respect to their academic records, such as “the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.” FERPA protects students from having their information disseminated to third parties without consent.

In accordance with this law, Portland State University has adopted rules to govern the gathering, use, and disclosure of student records with the aim of guaranteeing the privacy of such records. Under the Student Record rules, most of the records that the University maintains with regard to a student can only be disclosed to the student, University officials, sponsors of disbursed financial aid, or government agencies upon receipt of lawful subpoenas.

### Online Proctoring and Data Privacy

Portland State University’s School of Business uses an automated, third party, remote proctoring service to monitor and regulate student behavior during online exams. The current service employed— Proctorio—never holds unencrypted academic records. All data that enters its system has been encrypted by PSU’s learning management system (LMS) according to user roles, and can only be unlocked by authorized instructors and campus administrators within the LMS. This restricts information from being shared with users who do not possess a PSU "School Official" role, preventing unauthorized individuals and Proctorio from accessing student data.

-   Proctorio delivers all content via SSL (TLS 1.2), and their servers are compliant to PCI and HIPAA standards. Cookies used by the Services cannot be used to personally identify you.

-   Proctorio never requests disclosure of PII. When going through technical support channels, representatives see student inquiries as unique, randomized identifiers according to institution. The service is accessible through PSU’s LMS, with costs assumed by The School of Business, meaning no secondary accounts or payment information.

-   Proctorio is a Chrome extension that requires activation in order run within a section. This service only operates on specified quiz pages within the LMS.

## Title IX Reporting Policy

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. We expect a culture of professionalism and mutual respect in our department and class. You may report any incident of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, to either the [Office of Equity and Compliance] or [the Office of the Dean of Student Life].

Please be aware that as a faculty member, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination. If preferred, you can instead share information about sexual harassment or sexual violence with a [confidential employee] who does not have this reporting responsibility. These include:

-   Women’s Resource Center (503-725-5672)

-   Queer Resource Center (503-725-9742)

-   Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC): 1880 SW 6th Ave, (503) 725-2800

-   Student Legal Services: 1825 SW Broadway, (SMSU) M343, (503) 725-4556

## Safe Campus Module

Portland State University desires to create a safe campus for our students. As part of that mission, PSU requires all students to take the learning module entitled *Creating a Safe Campus: Preventing Gender Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault*. For more information about Title IX, please complete the required student module [Creating a Safe Campus] in D2L.

If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources on PSU’s Enrollment Management & Student Affairs: Sexual Prevention & Response website at http://www.pdx.edu/sexual-assault.

## Diversity perspectives

This course’s learning objectives, learning outcomes and course content reflect a full range of perspectives in the field of “Supply chain management”.  Course readings have been selected to reflect a
diverse range of perspectives.  Issues of diversity related to “global culture and values” will be discussed throughout this course and students will learn to apply these factors in the simulation and modeling exercises.  Additionally, students will work in small groups where a diverse range of ideas can be shared.  The focus on inclusion and diversity is one of the core values of the SB and this course will provide a space for all perspectives and opinions.

## Diversity engagement

In this course, students will work with one another in small groups throughout the course to apply concepts to practice. Student solutions will then be shared in a large group discussion. The instructor
ensures that all students are welcome to contribute to the discussion and ask questions. The online classroom will offer student a number of different modalities for learning and participating (videos,
discussion board, online exams, Google Hangout, etc).
